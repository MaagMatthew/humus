                    About Us
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We are a company that really values you day-to-day use of hummus, you dip it or eat it by itself, it's hummus. 
                    We take the finest ingredients from all over the world to complete and perfect our quality hummus. 
                    From Washington, USA to Tanzania, Africa.
                    "Hummus" comes from the Arabic word meaning "chickpeas", and the complete name of the prepared spread in Arabic is hummus bi tahina which means "chickpeas with tahini".
                    Spelling of the word in English can be inconsistent. "Hummus" is the most common spelling in both American and British English. 
                    The spelling "houmous" is however common enough in British English to be also listed as a less common spelling in some UK dictionaries but not, for example, in the Cambridge online dictionary.
                    Some US dictionaries also list other spellings such as humus, hommus, and hommos, but not Merriam-Webster, for example.

                This is the worst hummus ever, buy Sabra instead.

                I don't know what they put in their hummus, but I've been having a great conversation with this zebra for about 2 hours now.
